		<h1>Temporarily Under Construction</h1>

		<p>Jacqueline Wu is a designer and artist working at
			the intersection of  digital technologies and the
			physical world. Her explorations of memory,  identity,
			surveillance, and the city take forms as vast as
			installations, objects, images, interactions, and
			algorithms. Prior to  pursuing her MFA in Design and
			Technology at Parsons in New York, she  studied and
			practiced architecture in the Bay Area. </p>
